        "description": "Welcome to the ULTIMATE petrol vs electric drag race! \n\nWe’ve got our hands on the all-new Tesla Cybertruck, and it’s lining up alongside the a Lamborghini Urus! But which will come out on top - petrol, or electric? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. It also has a top speed of 130mph. \n\nThen we have the Lambo. It’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, and this can produce 650hp and 850Nm of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed torque converter gearbox, and it’s a whole lot lighter than the Tesla, tipping the scales at 2,200kg. It also has a much bigger top speed, coming in at 190mph. \n\nSo the Cybertruck has the Urus beat when it comes to performance stats, but will the extra weight drag it down? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!",

        "description": "From the executive producers of Band of Brothers and The Pacific comes Masters of the Air. The 9-part series event premieres January 26 https://apple.co/_MastersOfTheAir\n\nBased on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, “Masters of the Air” follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.\n\nThe series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, \"Masters of the Air\" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television’s Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone’s Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.\n\nThe series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, \"Masters of the Air\" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television’s Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone’s Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

          "description": "In this video, I measure a wave of electricity traveling down a wire, and answer the question - how does electricity know where to go? How does \"electricity\" \"decide\" where electrons should be moving in wires, and how long does that process take? Spoiler alert - very fast!\n\nI've been very excited about this project for a while - it was a lot of work to figure out a reliable way to make these measurements, but I've learned SO much by actually watching waves travel down wires, and I hope you do too!\n\nThere will be a Q&A about this video posted in a few weeks on the second channel, and if you head over there right now, you'll see two direct follow ups to this video with experimental details, and a section about \"impedance matching\" that was cut from this script.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@AlphaPhoenix2\n\nSpecial thanks to my top Patreon supporters!\nbirdiesnbritts\nJohn Sosa Trustham\nVladimir Shklovsky\nAloysius Sparglepartz\nRyan M\nJason Whatley\nLohann Paterno Coutinho Ferreira\nKasper Nielsen\nJeffrey Mckishen\nhttps://www.patreon.com/AlphaPhoenix\n\nMedia Credits:\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...) http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\nArcadia - Wonders by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100326 Artist: http://incompetech.com/"

        "description": "Witness the rise of a new empire. #GodzillaXKong - Only in theaters 2024\n\nThe epic battle continues!  Legendary Pictures’ cinematic Monsterverse follows up the explosive showdown of “Godzilla vs. Kong” with an all-new adventure that pits the almighty Kong and the fearsome Godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world, challenging their very existence—and our own. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” delves further into the histories of these Titans and their origins, as well as the mysteries of Skull Island and beyond, while uncovering the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings and tied them to humankind forever.\n\nOnce again at the helm is director Adam Wingard.  The film stars Rebecca Hall (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” The Night House”), Brian Tyree Henry (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Bullet Train”), Dan Stevens (“Gaslit,” “Legion,” “Beauty and the Beast”), Kaylee Hottle (“Godzilla vs. Kong”), Alex Ferns (“The Batman,” “Wrath of Man,” “Chernobyl”) and Fala Chen (“Irma Vep,” “Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”).\n\nThe screenplay is by Terry Rossio (“Godzilla vs. Kong” the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series) and Simon Barrett (“You’re Next”) and Jeremy Slater (“Moon Knight”), from a story by Rossio & Wingard & Barrett, based on the character “Godzilla” owned and created by TOHO Co., Ltd..  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, Eric Mcleod, Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Brian Rogers.  The executive producers are Wingard, Jen Conroy, Jay Ashenfelter, Yoshimitsu Banno, Kenji Okuhira. \n\nOnce again, Wingard is collaborating with director of photography Ben Seresin (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “World War Z”), production designer Tom Hammock (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “X,” “The Guest”), editor Josh Schaeffer (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Molly’s Game”), costume designer Emily Seresin (“The Invisible Man,” “Top of the Lake”).  The composers are Tom Holkenborg (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”) and Antonio Di Iorio (additional music on “Godzilla vs. Kong,” the “Sonic the Hedgehog” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Adam Wingard, “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.”  It is slated for release nationwide only in theaters and IMAX on April 12, 2024 and beginning 10 April 2024 internationally, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures except in Japan, where the film will be distributed by Toho Co., Ltd and in mainland China, where it will be distributed by Legendary East.",
